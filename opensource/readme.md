# DigitalPlat FreeDomain Open Source
This folder contains selected parts of our front-end and back-end code that are currently open-sourced.

DigitalPlat is a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting open-source and free software. We strongly believe in transparency and community collaboration. However, due to limited engineering resources and the lack of comprehensive security audits, our back-end codebase has not yet been fully open-sourced.

At the current stage, fully opening the back-end without sufficient review and maintenance capacity could introduce avoidable security risks. For this reason, we are taking a cautious, phased approach to open-sourcing, prioritizing safety and long-term sustainability.

We plan to gradually open-source more components as audits are completed and additional engineering capacity becomes available. The files in this folder represent the portions of the project that are safe and ready for public release at this time.
