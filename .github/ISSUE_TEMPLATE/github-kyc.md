### KYC Using Your GitHub Account

Please make sure your GitHub account meets the following requirements (all are required):

- [x] The issue title **must** be: Request GitHub KYC - Your US.KG Panel registered username. This ensures our automated script can detect your registered username. (For example, your title should be:  **Request GitHub KYC-example**)
- [x] This is not a new GitHub account; it has existing repositories and stars. (New registered GitHub accounts are not accepted)
- [x] This is my first DigitalPlat FreeDomain account.
- [x] I promise not to use the domain name for criminal or abusive purposes. 

**Your Account Details (US.KG NIC Panel):**

Please fill out the following information; otherwise, your request will not be processed:

- Username: **mrchanmp**
- Reason for Registering the .US.KG Domain Name (Why): I am _an hobbyist_ in learning to deploy web pages and blog-sites for *educational purposes*. And then, `every projects under my deployments` are always `Non-profit and Non-commercial`.
