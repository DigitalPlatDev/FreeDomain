# Tutorials

Welcome to the DigitalPlat documentation tutorials.

These guides walk you through using DigitalPlat step by step, from first registration to advanced usage.

If you’re new to DigitalPlat, start with **Getting Started**.

## Getting Started

This section is for first-time users.

You’ll learn how to:

- Create a DigitalPlat account  
- Set up DNS hosting for your domain  
- Prepare your domain for activation and use  

→ Go to: [Getting Started](./getting-started/index.md)

(Other sections are working in progress.)

## Who These Tutorials Are For

These tutorials are designed for:

- First-time domain users  
- Developers hosting personal or project domains  
- Open-source projects and nonprofits  

No prior DNS or domain experience is required.

## Notes for Advanced Users

If you already manage your own DNS or infrastructure, you can skip beginner sections and configure DigitalPlat directly.

DigitalPlat works with any standard DNS provider and does not lock you into a specific platform.
