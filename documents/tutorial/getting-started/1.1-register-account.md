# Creating Your DigitalPlat Domain Account

This is the first step. Once your account is ready, you’ll be able to claim and manage free domains from the dashboard.

## Step 1: Open the Registration Page

Open the registration page in your browser:

👉 https://dash.domain.digitalplat.org/auth/register

No login is required at this stage.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Account

Fill in the registration form with the following information.

**Username**
 Choose a unique username. This name will appear in your dashboard and in WHOIS records.
 Stick to letters and numbers to avoid issues later.

**Password**
 Use a strong password.
 At least 12 characters is recommended, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

**Email Address**
 Use a real, frequently checked email address.
 It’s required for password recovery, important notifications, and WHOIS contact.

Make sure you keep access to this email. Changing it later requires verification.

## Step 3: Provide WHOIS Information

Domain registration requires basic WHOIS details. Please enter:

- Full name or organization name
- Address
- Phone number

By default, this information is publicly visible in WHOIS lookups.

You can enable WHOIS Privacy Protection in the dashboard after registration to hide these details.

## Step 4: Read and Accept the Policies

Before submitting, make sure you’ve read and agreed to the following documents:

- Terms of Service
- Privacy Policy
- Acceptable Use Policy

Only click **Register** if you understand and agree to all of them.

## Done 🎉

After registration, you’ll be redirected to the dashboard.

Your account is now ready, and you can start claiming and managing your free domains.
